# Contact Information Extractor Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension extracts contact information from highlighted text using the Gemini AI API and allows saving to VCF files or Google Contacts.

## Setup Instructions

1. Install the extension in Chrome
2. Configure the extension settings (click extension icon -> right-click -> Options):

   a. Get Gemini API Key:
   - Visit https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
   - Create a new API key if you don't have one
   - Copy and paste the key into the extension settings

   b. Get OAuth Client ID:
   - Visit https://console.cloud.google.com
   - Create a new project or select an existing one
   - Enable the People API in the API Library
   - Go to Credentials and create a new OAuth 2.0 Client ID
   - Set Application Type to "Chrome Extension"
   - For Application ID, use your extension ID (found in chrome://extensions)
   - Add "https://people.googleapis.com/auth/contacts" to the scopes
   - Copy and paste the Client ID into the extension settings

## Usage

1. Highlight any text containing contact information
2. Right-click and select "Extract Contact Info"
3. The extension will analyze the text and display extracted contact details
4. You can then:
   - Edit the extracted information if needed
   - Download as a VCF file
   - Save directly to Google Contacts (requires Google account authorization)

## Supported Contact Fields

- Name
- Email
- Phone
- Company
- Title
- Address

## Troubleshooting

- If contact extraction fails, try highlighting a smaller, more focused section of text
- Ensure both the Gemini API key and OAuth Client ID are correctly configured
- For Google Contacts integration, make sure you're signed into Chrome with your Google account
- Check the browser console for detailed error messages if issues persist
